##AutoHotkey Script##

This script is influenced by the one found [here](https://gist.github.com/Danik/5808330). I've removed all extraneous commands and added a few of my own.

In order to ensure that the script runs automatically upon restarting, it must be placed here (assuming that the machine is running Windows 10): C:\Users\[userName]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
